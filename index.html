            <h2>How...</h2>
            <p>First this was hard to complete and I am proud that I was able to do it, but it was a rollercoaster of pain.</p> 
            <p>To how I actually did it. Started with reseach and watching Coding2Go's <a rel = "Coding2Go video" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gKEUYarehE&t=195s">Video</a>, this gave me a good starting point and understanding. 
            After gaining a starting point I exmpermented and tested different ways to "carry over" the dark mode. 
            I failed, so many times, so I started to reseach again. 
            This time finding "localStroage", just what I was looking for. 
            localStroage is basically cookies but not server dependent for what I get of it. which happens to make it perfect for the dark mode setting.
            Next is figuring out how to correctly use it. Which in itself not too hard and nether was applying it to my project.
            After about two hours of reseach and testing, I got it to randomally work and keep working from there onward.</p>
